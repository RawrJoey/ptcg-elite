It's so great to finally have Twinleaf available to the public. It's been a long year and a half of development, but I'm grateful to have had help from Eric and Tommy over the past several months. I hope you all enjoy what we've made, and if you have any suggestions or questions, bug reports or anything else, please don't hestitate to check out our Discord server!

We will use this News section to not only post feature updates, but also changelogs with bug fixes.

If you want to connect personally, you can find me on X @The_EPSD. Thank you all and I can't wait to hear feedback from everyone!
        
Joe`,
