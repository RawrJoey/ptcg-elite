# PTCG Elite [Working Title]
# Pokemon Trading Card Game Simulator

The project is created to allow players of the Pokemon Trading Card Game to experience current and past formats that are not otherwise accesible in an online, web-based client.

There are two projects:

* **ptcg-server** is the game server. It is responsible for calculating the game state and propagating it to the connected clients by websockets.

* **ptcg-play** is a web application written in Angular. It displays the game state and allows interaction with the server.

### Server launch

Server is a simple node.js application written in TypeScript. It uses express with websockets and [typeorm](https://typeorm.io/#/) for database access.

Prerequisites:
* Node.js 8 LTS or higher
* mysql-5 or sqlite-3

`config.js` contains all available options and its default values are defined in the `src/config.ts`

1. Install all required dependencies.

```
npm install
```

2. Build the project and start it.

```
npm run build
npm start
```

The service should now listen on the specified address and port. It will be http://localhost:12021 by default. This can be changed by editing `config.js` as previously mentioned. This server uses Sqlite-3.

### Client launch

The client is an Angular application.
https://angular.io/. 
The source code of the client is located in the `ptcg-play` directory.

The server package is a dependency required by the client. First you must build the server, then the client.

1. When the server is running, you can go now to the `ptcg-play` directory and install dependencies.

```
npm install
```

2. Start the aplication.

```
npm start
```

The command above will start the application in the debug mode at http://localhost:4200
